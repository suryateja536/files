And I completed Azure Fundamentals external Certificate and a accelerate task based on NER.Due to lack of awareness I was not informing about not going to office before .I hope you understand the circumstances and I am sure that i will not repeat this again and i will come to the office according the Mandate .I attached the certificates and my grandma health reports regarding surgery as below.

For June, i have 12 days of WFH - due to surgery for my grandmother and my personal sickness, i had applied 7 Exceptional WFH's [from 19/06/2024 to 28/06/2024 ].
For July, i have 15 days of WFH- i had applied 2 exception from 25/07/2024 to 26/07/2024.
